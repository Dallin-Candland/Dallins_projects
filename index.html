    <h2>I'm passionate about Automotive design, software development, and video game design</h2>
    <p><b>Auto Design</b><br>I have not taken any formal education on car design, but that
        hasn't stoped me from enjoying it as a side hobby. I like to conceptualize cars for
        different brands, and designing original concept cars. My favorite project has been designing
        a Super Sedan, which is a mid sized sedan,
        with graphics/features of an exhotic italian sports car.</p>

            I enjoy organization, and creativity, which go hand in hand
            in sofware development. I'm excited to use what I learn into making my own projects, such
            as video game applications using Unity, or helping to develop applications that can be used
            to make tasks such as documentation/analytics simple and organized.</p>
